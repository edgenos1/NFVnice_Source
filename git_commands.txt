Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github :
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

You can see all branches created by using :
$ git branch

Add a new remote for your branch :
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] 

Push changes from your commit into your branch :
$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [name_of_your_branch]

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

Then you need to apply to merge changes, if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github :
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
